# Neorg Project - Norgfmt (norg.py)

This is a Python project dedicated to parsing and formatting `Neorg` files. Our primary aim is to provide a reliable, efficient and highly customizable `Neorg` formatter which adheres to Pythonic standards and the [Neorg Specification](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/norg-specs/blob/main/1.0-specification.norg). The project is currently under active development with the parser under construction and the formatter yet to be started.
